# Notes

> Begin with installation react-router-dom

> npm install react-router-dom

> This tutorial uses three main pages

    > Home Page
    > Profile Page
    > About Page

> Use the react-router-dom to get Linking in Navbar.js

> The basic idea is to use useState hooks to simulate a login system

> Then, there are two tags ess. 1) <Protected> 2) <Private>

> The <Protected> tag takes the loggedIn setter as a prop

> The <Private> tag takes the main body of the page to be displayed once <Protected> accomplishes the authentication

> If the <Protected> prop function returns FALSE, then it will route the User to the LogIn Page
